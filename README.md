Posters listing Security and Privacy conferences and journals
===============================================================================

There is one poster for conferences, one for journals, and maybe one for summer 
and winter schools (or other interesting meetings).  They're made to be printed 
on an A3 paper to hang on the wall in your office.

To build them: clone the submodules, then run `make all`.
